## Machine Learning for Text Classification – NLP (Twitter Sentiment Analysis)
Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLP
This project analyzes tweet sentiments using NLP techniques such as stopword removal, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, 
stemming, WordNet lemmatization, and WordCloud visualizations for positive and negative sentiments. 
Machine learning models—Naive Bayes, MultinomialNB, Linear SVC, and Logistic Regression—were evaluated.
Logistic Regression achieved the highest testing accuracy (78%), indicating strong generalization to unseen data,
while Linear SVC had the best training accuracy (90%), showing strong polarity classification during training.
